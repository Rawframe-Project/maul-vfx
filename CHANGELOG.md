# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before
1.0.0, any minor release may change the API and the ABI.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The library skeleton: the build, the family rules and tools, the
  version and result API (`mvfxGetVersion`, `mvfxResultName`) and the
  library profile.
- The context: `mvfxCreateContext` from a def stamped with the headers'
  version and carrying the host's allocator and task hooks,
  `mvfxDestroyContext` and `mvfxContext_GetMisuse`. Work handed to the
  host's tasks runs in round to nearest with subnormals kept, whatever
  floating-point mode the host's threads are in.
- `mvfxHash64`, the family's 64-bit hash, which the determinism checks
  and effect identities are built on.
- Curves and gradients as effects state them (`maul-vfx/curve.h`): keys
  with constant, linear or cubic segments, tangents given, smooth or
  monotone, and color and alpha keys.
- Effects (`maul-vfx/effect.h`): `mvfxCreateEffect` checks an effect def
  and its emitter defs (capacity, spawn rate, lifetime) and compiles them
  into one block, `mvfxDestroyEffect` and `mvfxEffect_IsValid` take its
  generation-checked id; the context's def gains a limit of effects.
