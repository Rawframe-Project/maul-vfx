## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The library skeleton: the build, the family rules and tools, the
  version and result API (`mvfxGetVersion`, `mvfxResultName`) and the
  library profile.
- The context: `mvfxCreateContext` from a def stamped with the headers'
  version and carrying the host's allocator and task hooks,
  `mvfxDestroyContext` and `mvfxContext_GetMisuse`. Work handed to the
  host's tasks runs in round to nearest with subnormals kept, whatever
  floating-point mode the host's threads are in.
- `mvfxHash64`, the family's 64-bit hash, which the determinism checks
  and effect identities are built on.
