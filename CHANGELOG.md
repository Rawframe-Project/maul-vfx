# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before
1.0.0, any minor release may change the API and the ABI.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The library skeleton: the build, the family rules and tools, the
  version and result API (`mvfxGetVersion`, `mvfxResultName`) and the
  library profile.
- The context: `mvfxCreateContext` from a def stamped with the headers'
  version and carrying the host's allocator and task hooks,
  `mvfxDestroyContext` and `mvfxContext_GetMisuse`. Work handed to the
  host's tasks runs in round to nearest with subnormals kept, whatever
  floating-point mode the host's threads are in.
- `mvfxHash64`, the family's 64-bit hash, which the determinism checks
  and effect identities are built on.
- Curves and gradients as effects state them (`maul-vfx/curve.h`): keys
  with constant, linear or cubic segments, tangents given, smooth or
  monotone, and color and alpha keys.
- Effects (`maul-vfx/effect.h`): `mvfxCreateEffect` checks an effect def
  and its emitter defs (capacity, spawn rate, lifetime) and compiles them
  into one block, `mvfxDestroyEffect` and `mvfxEffect_IsValid` take its
  generation-checked id; the context's def gains a limit of effects.
- Instances and the step (`maul-vfx/instance.h`): `mvfxCreateInstance`
  plays an effect at a double-precision origin with a seed,
  `mvfxContext_Step` and `mvfxContext_StepTicks` advance every instance
  on a clock of 2^-20 s ticks, births at exact ticks and deaths from each
  particle's birth tick, so spans whose ticks sum alike reach the same
  state; `mvfxInstance_GetEmitterStats` reads live, owed and refused
  counts. An effect an instance plays refuses destruction
  (`mvfx_errorBusy`); the context's def gains a limit of instances.
- Emitter lives: a start delay, a duration and a loop count; a rate
  curve over each loop's normalized age; bursts with counts drawn from a
  range, cycles, an interval and a chance (`mvfxBurst`). Emitter states
  (`mvfxEmitterStatus` in `mvfxEmitterStats`), `mvfxInstance_IsFinished`,
  `mvfxInstance_Stop` and `mvfxInstance_Restart`.
- Changed: the rate's k-th birth is where its integral reaches k + 1, so
  a rate of 0 spawns nothing and nothing is born at the emitter's start;
  the golden state hashes change with it.
- Spawn shapes and initial velocity (`maul-vfx/shape.h`): point, line,
  circle and arc, sphere, hemisphere, box and cone, on their surface, in
  a shell or in their volume, turned and moved within the emitter; arc
  modes random, loop, ping-pong and burst spread; a direction from the
  shape's normal, its center, a cone or a fixed vector, randomized by a
  share, times a speed range. Particles now store a velocity.
- Meshes (`maul-vfx/mesh.h`): `mvfxCreateMesh` copies vertices, normals,
  triangles and tetrahedra; a mesh shape spawns at its vertices, on its
  edges by length, on its surface by area or in its volume by volume.
  `mvfxMesh_SetPositions` moves a skinned mesh between steps, and
  `mvfxInstance_SetEmitterMesh` binds an instance's own mesh. The
  context's def gains a limit of meshes.
